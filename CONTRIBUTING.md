## I Have a Question

Before asking a question, search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues) that might help. If you find a relevant issue and need clarification, ask your question there. It's also a good idea to search the internet for answers first.

If you still need to ask a question, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as possible about your situation.
- Include project and platform versions (Windows, AutoWall version, other software running in the background) when relevant.

We'll address the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A thorough bug report saves time for everyone involved. Please investigate, collect information, and describe the issue in detail before submitting your report. Complete the following steps beforehand to help us fix potential bugs quickly:

- Ensure you're using the latest version.
- Determine if it's truly a bug, rather than an error on your side (e.g., using incompatible environment components/versions). For support, check [this section](#i-have-a-question).
- Search [Issues](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If so, add a comment to the existing issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Platform, and Version (Windows).
  - AutoWall version.
  - Relevant background software.
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Can you reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you encounter an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues/new). (At this point, refrain from labeling it as a bug.)
- Explain the expected behavior and the actual behavior.
- Provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* for others to recreate the issue.

Once filed:

- The maintainer will label the issue accordingly.
- The maintainer will attempt to
reproduce the issue using your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue:
  - The issue will be marked with a related tag, and left for someone to implement a solution.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Autowall, **including new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Ensure you're using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If so, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Determine if your idea aligns with the project's scope and goals. Make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we aim for features that will benefit the majority of our users, not just a small subset.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain the desired behavior** and why. You can also mention which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Autowall users. You may want to reference other projects that have implemented similar features for inspiration.

## Pull Requests

You're amazing, seriously ðŸ’• All Pull Requests are welcome:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the commit.
- If your code implements unrelated features, split it into separate commits with **clear and descriptive titles**.
- Briefly **explain the usefulness of the changes** or **reference the issue number in the commit**.

That's it, simple! And you're still the best ðŸ’•
